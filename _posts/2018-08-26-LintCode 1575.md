## Description
There are n group children ready to go on a spring tour. The array a indicates the number of people in each group. There are no more than four people in each group. There are now several cars. Each car can only take up to four people. The same group of children must sit in the same car, and each car need't be full. Ask how many cars you need to meet the travel needs of your children.
Notes:
- 0 $\leq $ n $\leq $ 1e4  
- 1 $\leq $ a[i] $\leq $4

## Example
Given a = [1,2,3,4]，return 3.
Explanation:
At this time, there are 4 people in the fourth group, sitting alone in a car.
The first group has 1 person, the third group has 3 people, and just 4 people get for one car.
The second group of 2 people has a single car, so at least 3 cars are needed.

Given a = [1,2,2,2]，return 2.
Explanation:
The first group and the second group get one car
The third group and the fourth group get one car
Therefore, at least two cars are needed.

## Solution:
```java
public int getAnswer(int[] a) {
    int[] bucket = new int[5];
    for (int i = 0;i < a.length; i++){
        bucket[a[i]]++;
    }
    int car = bucket[4];
    int two = bucket[2] / 2;
    bucket[2] = bucket[2] % 2;   //剩余0 或者 1
    car += two;
    if (bucket[1] <= bucket[3]) {//3多1完     / 3完1完
        car += bucket[1];
        bucket[3] -= bucket[1];
        bucket[1]=0;
        car += bucket[2];
        car += bucket[3];
     } else {     //1多 3完
        car+=bucket[3];
        bucket[1] -= bucket[3];
        bucket[3] = 0;
        int sum = bucket[1]+bucket[2]*2;
        car = car + sum / 4 + sum % 4 == 0 ? 0 : 1;
    }
    return car;
}
```
